                <h2><b>Lailatul Qadr: The Night of Power</b></h2>
                <p>Lailatul Qadr, known as the <strong>Night of Power</strong>, is one of the most sacred nights in Islam. It is believed to be the night when the <strong>Holy Quran</strong> was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). This night holds immense spiritual significance and is described in the Quran as being <strong>better than a thousand months</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3><b>The Revelation and Significance</b></h3>
                <p>According to Islamic tradition, Lailatul Qadr falls within the last <strong>ten nights of Ramadan</strong>, specifically on one of the odd-numbered nights (21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, or 29th). Though the exact date is unknown, the <strong>27th night of Ramadan</strong> is most commonly observed as Lailatul Qadr.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Indeed, We sent the Quran down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit (Jibreel) descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.</em> (Quran 97:1-5)</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h3><b>A Story from the Time of the Prophet</b></h3>
                <p>One day, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shared with his companions a story of a <strong>righteous man from the past</strong> who worshipped Allah for <strong>1,000 months (83 years and 4 months) without rest</strong>. The companions were astonished and wished they could achieve such devotion. In response, Allah revealed Surah Al-Qadr, telling them that worshipping on Lailatul Qadr is equivalent to worshipping for <strong>a thousand months</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3><b>What to Do on Lailatul Qadr?</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Praying Tahajjud (Night Prayers):</strong> Engaging in extra prayers and seeking forgiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reciting the Quran:</strong> Reading and reflecting upon the words of Allah.</li>
                    <li><strong>Making Du’a (Supplication):</strong> Asking Allah for mercy, guidance, and forgiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seeking Forgiveness:</strong> The Prophet (PBUH) taught a special dua to say on this night:</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Allahumma innaka ‘afuwwun tuhibbul ‘afwa fa’fu ‘anni</em> (O Allah, You are Most Forgiving, and You love to forgive, so forgive me.)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Giving Charity:</strong> Helping those in need brings great rewards, especially on this night.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3><b>A Night of Transformation</b></h3>
                <p>Many Muslims have experienced life-changing moments on Lailatul Qadr. It is said that those who spend the night in sincere worship, with a <strong>pure heart and deep devotion</strong>, will have their <strong>past sins forgiven</strong> and their <strong>prayers answered</strong>. The spiritual energy and peace that descend on this night leave a lasting impact on the hearts of believers.</p>
                
                <p>May we all be blessed to witness Lailatul Qadr and receive its <strong>countless blessings</strong>. Ameen.</p>
